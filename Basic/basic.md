# C++ Basic Syntax
When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.

Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.

Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.

Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.
